# üçå Banana Foundation Website Project

![](docs/header.png?raw=true)

This is the Front End Coding Challenge from CodeDoor. I have to treat this challenge as if I am working as a front end developer at a web development agency. My task is to turn a designer mockup into code with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

## üóÇ Provided Assets

- Designfile ([Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Y9zKhjbgHYD5ft5OLrggYjw8/Banana_Foundation_Challenge?node-id=0%3A1)/[PDF](docs/designfile.pdf)): This file shows what the page should like and its content.
- [Style Guide](https://www.figma.com/file/Y9zKhjbgHYD5ft5OLrggYjw8/Banana_Foundation_Challenge?node-id=44%3A2): This file will help to identify font sizes, font families and colors across the site.
- [Hamburger Menu Design](https://www.figma.com/file/Y9zKhjbgHYD5ft5OLrggYjw8/Banana_Foundation_Challenge?node-id=1181%3A26): This file shows what the hamburger menu should like and its content.
- Create a Figma Account to see all details of the design mockup.

## üí° How to use

- `index.html`: This file will contain my HTML code.
- `main.css`: This file will contain my CSS and some boilerplate code.
- Subfolders like `img` and `js` contain all of the necessary resources needed by `index.html`(images, JavaScript etc.) and are linked together for your convience.

## ü§ì What I have learnt

- Figma and development process. Nowadays, design collaboration tools like Figma, InVision etc are widely used to hand off the projects from designers to developers.
- Flexbox & CSS Grid: How to make the elements in place and responsive
- Use CSS hover feature for the hamburger menu rather than JavaScript.
